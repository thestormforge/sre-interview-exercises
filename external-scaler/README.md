# external-scaler exercise

We, at StormForge, are fans of autoscaling in kubernetes. HPA already offers a basic set of capabilities which when combined with things like [Keda](https://keda.sh/) allow many more possibilities.

In this exercise, you will help us use our internal license service which keeps track of our customers subscription to scale up/down the backend services corresponding to their tenant.
